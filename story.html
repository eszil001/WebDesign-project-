     <!--THE TEXT WITH APPLIED CSS--> 

        <p> Sisi has always been a curious little puppy, even to this day she loves to explore the unknow, she is truly an inspiration to us all. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I still remember the day I got her, after a few begs to my parents that we should get a dog, they finally gave in and said yes. Thats when Sisi join the family, she was as little as my palm very lazy to even walk, she was very confused born with 2 brothers that now have somehow disappeared and she is in a new house, I cant blame her I would have been confused too.
        </p>
        <div>
        <img class="float-img " src="pictures/636208771400786438.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt="Picture of sisi my dog, sleeping on her bed when she was little"/></div>
        <p>
        The first few days she mostly spent them sleeping and eating, I used to mix her baby mild powder in her food, so she can get her full vitamins she needs.
        </p>
        <p>
        I remember she hated, still hates to this day, to sleep on dog beds, I tried my parents tried but she just hates them. When she was little she used to sleep next to me in her bed, but as fast as I fell asleep she jumped off her bed and laid beside me, since she was always there when I woke up. I stopped insisting with the bed since clearly, she wanted to be beside me so from there on every night she sleps like a little human.
        </p> 
    



        <p>
        I also remember my dad wasnt too keen on having a dog, he always said he wont care for her is my responsibility which I suppose is to be expected but to my surprise somehow Sisi managed to soften his heart to the point where Sisi no longer slept beside me but beside him.

        </p>
        <p>
        My dad started loving Sisi to the point where they become inseparable once dad was home from work Sisi was with him and not leaving his side for one minute. She always jumps around and wiggles her tail when any of us get home from work or school, she is so happy to see us home and we are so happy to have her.    
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href= "https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Russell_Terrier" >Jack russell terriers</a> are knows to be hyper energetic which she was too, always running, chasing something that only she could understand or playing with me.   
        </p>

        <img class="float-img1 " src="pictures/2012-07-29%2020.40.38.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt="Picture of sisi my dog, when she was little and playing outside"/> </div>
    

        <p>
        She loved to play in our garden, back in Romania, she would chase the chickens and annoy them anytime she had the chance too, but she would never bite them. I remember one day she found a way out of the garden and she instantly ran away, me and my parents spent 1 hour yelling her name and looking after her, when we suddenly see her walking victoriously towards us, after that she never run away again and would always follow us everywhere we go, I wonder what she found that day.

        </p>
        <p>
        Then she started her obsession with plushies, she loves them even to this days and has hundreds of them, she used to lay in bed and play with her toys while we watch tv or talk, she was always on bed biting her toys then when she gets tired she just falls asleep with her toy in her mouth.  
        </p>
        <p>
        I used to give her my plushie toys the ones that wouldnt rip easily and she was so happy to get new ones, her happiness and reaction when you give her a new toy is just priceless.
        </p>

        <img class="float-img " src="pictures/2012-07-29%2020.38.17.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt="Picture of sisi my dog, laying on grass"/> </div>
        <p>
        She also loved to play with our cat Pumukli, he wasnt too keen on playing with her, but they got along so well, that sometimes they even slept next to each other, She loved Pumukli, unfortunately Pumukli has passed away and she become lonely, she misses that ginger kitty. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The times they chased each other were hilarious to watch, Sisi chasing him then Pumukli chasing her back. However she still remembers his name to this day and if I ask her where is Pumukli she instantly looks up to me. 
        </p> 
    



        <p>
        Sisi has travelled a lot and will travel more, she has seen a lot of cities, however she does get motion sick sometimes, but the parks she has been and people she has seen made up for it. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Her happiness could cheer up anyone, since little she always barks on people that get to close to us while we walk her, I think she tries to protect us, they say dogs know who is a good person and who isnt, the have a special sense that humans dont poses.
        </p>
       
        <div>
        <img class="float-img1 " src="pictures/12.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt="Picture of sisi my dog, playing with her toy"/> </div>

        <p>
        Sisi is no longer just a dog or a pet, she became a family member, she is my sister and  my parents lover her so much just like someone would love their kids, honestly someone who never had an experience like this where you can call your dog a family member is missing out on a lot of things, and for those that have a dog and when they come home from work or school, and he doesnt get happy and the tail doesnt wiggle, they are doing something wrong and should spend more time thinking about their choices and actions.
        </p> 
        <p>
       I realized that us humans we dont deserve dogs, their unconditional love and happiness they but also calming effect they have when you hug them, is feeling that cant be described in words. I am grateful to have sisi in my life and I hope she stay forever with us.
        </p>

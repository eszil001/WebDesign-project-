            <h3 class="text">My name is Sisi, am a playful little doggie that looooves to eat and sleep, and sometimes chew on toys my humans bought me, I have so many that sometimes I struggle choosing one to play with, so I play with 2 instead of one, why would I choose when I can have both? However my favourite ones have to be the bird toys that make a weird sound when I bite them, I still don’t understand why they make that noise but I love it and my humans seem to realize that too, which makes me very happy.</h3>
            <h3 class="text"> I LOVE EATING did I mention that? I think I did, sometimes my humans hide the food from me I even heard one of them say I look like a sausage or that I eat too much, but am not fat, my coat is just puffy. However they buy my this “treats” as they call them which I looooooove they are delicious I could eat 10000000.</h3>
            <h3 class="text"> I love my humans they always take care of me, they always want the best for me, sometimes they tease me by stealing my toys and making me jump for them, but I enjoy it, I love playing with them. I remember I had terrible eye pain that made me very sad I couldn’t eat, which you know I love, but one day my humans took me to a place and when I woke up, the pain was suddenly gone I could finally be happy again then the next sound I heard was my humans voice they were there too. Something seemed strange, the world was suddenly darker than usually, when I had eyes pain I could barely see my humans but now its different I can see them with my ears and heart.</h3>
